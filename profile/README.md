### 🚀 Mission
Enterprises are moving from **"Building Agents"** to **"Governing Agent Fleets."**
The current stack is fragmented. We are building the missing orchestration layer that sits above your agent framework (Vellum, LangChain, etc.) and below your compliance policies.

**Rainminds** is the engineering entity behind **Gantral** (Open Protocol) and **Gantrio** (Enterprise Platform).

### 🛠 Projects

#### 🟢 Gantral (Open Source)
> *Status: In Development (Private Beta)*
> **The Service Mesh for AI Agents.**
>
> Just as Istio manages traffic between microservices, Gantral manages **intent and execution** between agents.
> - **Protocol:** Standardized "Intent-Plan-Execute" lifecycle.
> - **Governance:** Policy-as-Code checks before any agent tool use.
> - **Audit:** Full replayability of agent reasoning chains.
>
> 🔜 *Public Repo launching Q1 2026. [Request Early Access](mailto:abhishek@rainminds.com?subject=Gantral%20Early%20Access)*

#### 🔵 Gantrio (Enterprise)
> *Status: Stealth*
> **The Control Plane for Regulated Industries.**
>
> A unified dashboard to manage, monitor, and govern AI agents at scale.
> - **Audit Trails:** Every agent decision, logged and replayable.
> - **Cost Governance:** Token budgeting per team, not just per model.
> - **RBAC:** Fine-grained permissions for human-agent collaboration.

### 🤝 Community & Standards
We believe in "Listen, Then Lead." We are actively participating in:
- **CNCF TAG App Delivery** (Platforms Working Group)
<!-- - **AI Alliance** (Safe AI Governance) -->

We are defining the **"Agent Governance Standard"** before we ship the code.
